                The Paris Agreement is a document signed by various countries in
                2015 to reduce usage to 45% by the end of 2030. The goal for the
                United States is to reduce carbon emissions to zero by 2050. As
                a push for that goal, the Solar Decathlon competition seeks to
                train students to join the clean energy workforce. Buildings use
                approximately 30% of the USâ€™s total energy usage. To reach a net
                zero carbon goal by 2050, the Solar Decathlon is looking to
                train students by designing net zero energy homes for
                disadvantaged communities.
              </p>

                The University of Washington Solar Decathlon team started in
                Autumn 2023 when a student developed the idea to start the first
                ever Building Science RSO on campus. Starting off with small
                group meetings at Gould Hall, the club has grown into a group
                that learns about innovative energy techniques each day. With
                Faculty Lead Rob Pena backing the team, the Solar Decathlon
                group has a great backing for future competitions.

                Founded by a student in Autumn 2023, the University of
                Washington Solar Decathlon team is the first Building Science
                RSO on campus. Our team consists of students across various
                majors, all with a passion for renewable energy. We first
                competed in the 2024 Solar Decathlon as a team of 20 students.
                With the support of our faculty lead, Rob Pena, we look forward
                to future competitions and the continued growth of our club!

                The Paris Agreement was a document signed by over 190 countries
                in 2015 to reduce carbon emissions by 45% by 2030 and achieve
                net zero by 2050. Since buildings account for approximately 35%
                of carbon emissions in the US and 40% of its energy usage, the
                Solar Decathlon challenges students to design low-carbon, net
                zero energy homes for disadvantaged communities. For students
                preparing to join the clean energy workforce, the Solar
                Decathlon is an excellent opportunity to gain real-life
                experience designing buildings for a more sustainable world.
