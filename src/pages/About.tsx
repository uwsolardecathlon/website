              The Paris Agreement is a document signed by various countries in 2015 to reduce usage to 45% by the end of 2030. The goal for the United States is to reduce carbon emissions to zero by 2050. As a push for that goal, the Solar Decathlon competition seeks to train students to join the clean energy workforce. Buildings use approximately 30% of the USâ€™s total energy usage. To reach a net zero carbon goal by 2050, the Solar Decathlon is looking to train students by designing net zero energy homes for disadvantaged communities.

              The University of Washington Solar Decathlon team started in Autumn 2023 when a student developed the idea to start the first ever Building Science RSO on campus. Starting off with small group meetings at Gould Hall, the club has grown into a group that learns about innovative energy techniques each day. With Faculty Lead Rob Pena backing the team, the Solar Decathlon group has a great backing for future competitions.
