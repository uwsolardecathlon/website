              The Paris Agreement is a document signed by various countries in
              2015 to reduce usage to 45% by the end of 2030. The goal for the
              United States is to reduce carbon emissions to zero by 2050. As a
              push for that goal, the Solar Decathlon competition seeks to train
              students to join the clean energy workforce. Buildings use
              approximately 30% of the USâ€™s total energy usage. To reach a net
              zero carbon goal by 2050, the Solar Decathlon is looking to train
              students by designing net zero energy homes for disadvantaged
              communities.

              The University of Washington Solar Decathlon team started in
              Autumn 2023 when a student developed the idea to start the first
              ever Building Science RSO on campus. Starting off with small group
              meetings at Gould Hall, the club has grown into a group that
              learns about innovative energy techniques each day. With Faculty
              Lead Rob Pena backing the team, the Solar Decathlon group has a
              great backing for future competitions.

              The Paris Agreement was a document signed by over 190 countries in 
              2015 to reduce carbon emissions by 45% by 2030 and achieve net zero 
              by 2050. Since buildings account for approximately 35% of carbon
              emissions in the US and 40% of its energy usage, the Solar Decathlon 
              challenges students to design low-carbon, net zero energy homes for 
              disadvantaged communities.
            </p>
            <p>
              For students preparing to join the clean energy workforce, the Solar
              Decathlon is an excellent opportunity to gain real-life experience
              designing buildings for a more sustainable world.
