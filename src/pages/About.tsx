              The Paris Agreement is a document signed by various countries in
              2015 to reduce usage to 45% by the end of 2030. The goal for the
              United States is to reduce carbon emissions to zero by 2050. As a
              push for that goal, the Solar Decathlon competition seeks to train
              students to join the clean energy workforce. Buildings use
              approximately 30% of the USâ€™s total energy usage. To reach a net
              zero carbon goal by 2050, the Solar Decathlon is looking to train
              students by designing net zero energy homes for disadvantaged
              communities.

              The University of Washington Solar Decathlon team started in
              Autumn 2023 when a student developed the idea to start the first
              ever Building Science RSO on campus. Starting off with small group
              meetings at Gould Hall, the club has grown into a group that
              learns about innovative energy techniques each day. With Faculty
              Lead Rob Pena backing the team, the Solar Decathlon group has a
              great backing for future competitions.
