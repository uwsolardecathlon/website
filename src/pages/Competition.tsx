            <p>
              The Solar Decathlon is a collegiate competition sponsored by the
              US Department of Energy, consisting of a Design Challenge and a
              Build Challenge. We participate in the annual Design Challenge,
              which entails designing a high-performance, low-carbon building to
              address a real-world issue. Teams register in October, compete in
              the semifinals in February, then finalists present their design to
              the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Colorado. Each design
              is graded on 10 contests that are developed each year to inspire
              teams to learn new innovative techniques for designing net zero
              energy buildings.

              Designing a Net Zero Energy Home
            </Subtitle2>
            <p>
              When designing a net zero energy home, there are many factors to
              consider. Who are you designing your building for? What is the
              peak load of your building? Is it environmentally friendly? These
              questions and many others are asked by the jury to determine who
              wins the competition. In Washington State, it is simple to design
              a building with low operational carbon as the weather of
              Washington is around the average comfort level of 65 degrees
              Fahrenheit. When it comes to designing a new building, the biggest
              concern is embodied carbon.

          <p>
            Embodied carbon is the carbon dioxide (COâ‚‚) emissions associated
            with materials and construction processes throughout the entire
            life-cycle of a building or infrastructure. By minimizing the
            embodied carbon of a building, you can create the most sustainable
            buildings in the world. For some buildings, you could even store
            carbon from the atmosphere to reduce the effects of global warming.

            Conducting a site analysis
            Designing a building that follows passive design strategies and meets the needs of the target market
            Running energy modeling, embodied carbon analysis, financial analysis

            Revising the project summary based on feedback
            Creating full HVAC, electrical, and plumbing designs for the house
            Ensuring we follow all zero energy home codes, building codes, and structural codes
            Soliciting feedback from industry partners in architecture and engineering
            At the virtual semifinals in February, all teams present their projects to industry experts. Up to 10 teams per division are selected to advance to the final stage of the competition."

            Preparing a presentation and poster
            Recording a 90-second video pitch marketing our design to the jurors
            The finals take place in April at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Colorado. This event is an exciting opportunity for participants to present their final design, network, and connect with both peers and industry experts."
