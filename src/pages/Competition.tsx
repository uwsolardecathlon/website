          <p>
            The Solar Decathlon is a collegiate competition sponsored by the US
            Department of Energy, consisting of a Design Challenge and a Build
            Challenge. We participate in the annual Design Challenge, which
            entails designing a high-performance, low-carbon building to address
            a real-world issue. Teams register in October, compete in the
            semifinals in February, then finalists present their design to the
            National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Colorado. Each design is
            graded on 10 contests that are developed each year to inspire teams
            to learn new innovative techniques for designing net zero energy
            buildings.

            <p>
              When designing a net zero energy home, there are many factors to
              consider. Who are you designing your building for? What is the
              peak load of your building? Is it environmentally friendly? These
              questions and many others are asked by the jury to determine who
              wins the competition.
            </p>
            <p>
              In Washington State, it is simple to design a building with low
              operational carbon as the weather of Washington is around the
              average comfort level of 65 degrees Fahrenheit. When it comes to
              designing a new building, the biggest concern is embodied carbon.
            </p>
            <p>
              Embodied carbon is the carbon dioxide (COâ‚‚) emissions associated
              with materials and construction processes throughout the entire
              life-cycle of a building or infrastructure. By minimizing the
              embodied carbon of a building, you can create the most sustainable
              buildings in the world. For some buildings, you could even store
              carbon from the atmosphere to reduce the effects of global
              warming.
